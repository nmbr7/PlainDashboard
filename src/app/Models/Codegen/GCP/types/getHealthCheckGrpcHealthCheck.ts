The gRPC service name for the health check.

Specifies how port is selected for health checking, can be one of the

  - 'USE_FIXED_PORT': The port number in 'port' is used for health checking.

  - 'USE_SERVING_PORT': For NetworkEndpointGroup, the port specified for each
  network endpoint is used for health checking. For other backends, the
  port or named port specified in the Backend Service is used for health
  checking.
